## Eliza

*45, female, married, teacher*

Eliza is a kindergarden teacher. Her mother was recently diagnosed with Alzheimers and she's been reading a lot about the link between Alzhemiers and the aluminum contained in most antipersperants. She has 12-year-old girls of her own (Shelly and Melly), who are just discovering the thrills of using beauty products. She's deeply invested in the health of her children and is starting to become more and more wary about drug-store beauty products. Both she and her daughter Melly have chronic dandruff. 

**Personal goals**

- Avoiding aluminum-containing deoderants
- Creating a healthy environment for her girls
