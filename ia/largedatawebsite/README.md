# Natural Skincare

My topic of choice is natural skincare. Natural skincare involves reassesing the beauty and skincare products that we use on a daily basis. These products can include (but are not limited to): soaps, shampoos, conditioners, facial cleansers, deoderant and moisturizers. Many of these products contain chemicals that are detrimental to our health. A key component to natural skincare is avoiding many commercially-made products and creating your own.

The topic interests me because I have a personal investment in it, and have found it to make a difference in my life. There are many tiers to natural skincare; for example it can mean anything from switching to a sulfate-free shampoo, to ditching shampoo altogether. There is no one formula. It has a very DIY aspect, in that you have to figure out what works for you. That appeals to me because I believe that creating your own products can be more beneficial than products that are made for the masses. 



## Purpose

This project will give me practice creating responsive, large-scale websites. 

The purpose is to outline the problems with commercial hair and skincare products. It will explore alternative options by listing key natural ingredients and possible homemade recipes.

The project will help me culminate my own knowledge and research by organizing and presenting it to others.

## Target audience

The website is targeted at people who have heard of the health risks in their products, and need to know more. It would be for anyone looking for an organized database of natural skincare information to refer to.

It could also be targeted toward people who are unaware of the negative effects of commercial beauty/skincare products, but are willing to consider making alterations to their lifestyle.

It is targeted at people who have chronic skin conditions (acne, dandruff) and are willing to understand that their products could be contributing to the problem.
