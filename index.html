<h1>Sylvia McCauley</h1>

        <h2>WHO IS SHE?</h2>
        
        <p>Sylvia is a designer in Ottawa, Ontario. In a few short months she will be a graduate of the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. She's working at buffing up her portfolio and is keen to get her feet wet through an industry placement. She is excited to find her place in the industry - hopefully in motion graphics, web design, or branding (maybe all three!)  When she's not designing, Sylvia is probably either absorbed in bad TV or a good book â€“ and probably tweeting about it.</p>

        <h2>WHY DESIGN?</h2>
        
        <p>Sylvia coded her first website at the age of eleven. That website is long gone now, and that's probably a good thing. However, from an early age she developed a strong desire to communicate visually. She always loved the visual presentation aspect of school projects, and would fuss for hours over fonts in her essays. She discovered graphic design through her love of photography and typography in printed materials; she's always judged a book by its cover. She's become passionate about solving problems and delivering visual messages. Being a designer allows her to make connection with the world, and create a lasting imprint in her culture. Sylvia believes that good design is important and invaluable. Making a big chance in my HTML!</p>
